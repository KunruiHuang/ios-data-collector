@property(nonatomic, readonly) FourCharCode inputPixelFormat; // One of 420f, 420v, or BGRA

/* Resource Lifecycle */
// Prepare and destroy expensive resources inside these callbacks.
// The outputRetainedBufferCountHint tells out of place renderers how many of their output buffers will be held onto by the downstream pipeline at one time.
// This can be used by the renderer to size and preallocate their pools.

/* Rendering */
// Renderers which operate in place should return the input pixel buffer with a +1 retain count.
// Renderers which operate out of place should create a pixel buffer to return from a pool they own.
// When rendering to a pixel buffer with the GPU it is not necessary to block until rendering has completed before returning.
// It is sufficient to call glFlush() to ensure that the commands have been flushed to the GPU.
- (CVPixelBufferRef)copyRenderedPixelBuffer:(CVPixelBufferRef)pixelBuffer;

@optional

// This property must be implemented if operatesInPlace is NO and the output pixel buffers have a different format description than the input.
// If implemented a non-NULL value must be returned once the renderer has been prepared (can be NULL after being reset).
